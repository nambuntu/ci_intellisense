#CodeIgniter code intellisense support for Eclipse. 
## ci_intellisense
_@author: Nam Nguyen (namnvhue@gmail.com)_

This is a very helpful tool I developed for my team when they worked with some CI projects and I think it would be helpful to your team too. 
Check out and place this tool inside your CI project (the same directory level with application folder, rename the folder name in the code if needed, I just keep the default application name). 

When run the builder (using PHP CLI), two new fake Controller and Model will be created. 
These file will do the trick to Eclipse and make it possible for Code Intellisense.

_Happy Coding._
